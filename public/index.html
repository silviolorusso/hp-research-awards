Established by the Willem de Kooning Foundation, the awards are granted to outstanding graduation projects that provide new insights to broader audiences through their research. The series consists of a printed version and an electronic one for each publication. While the former explores the possibilities of print, the latter is a single standalone HTML file that can be easily saved, shared and archived.</p><div class="mast-head home"><div><a href="meat-market.html"><img src="assets/img/meat-market/cover.jpg"></a><h1>Meat Market</h1><h2>Daisy Tijssen </h2><p>Meat Market aims to raise awareness of meat that was not obtained from conventionally slaughtered animals. By turning animals into unrecognisable products, we strip away the layer of cultured nostalgia we project on them. At the same time, we go on wasting meat from healthy and consumable animals because we deem it socially unacceptable. Meat Market addresses the following questions: ‘Why does an average Dutch dinner have to contain meat?’, ‘Where does this desire for meat and its overconsumption come from?’, and ‘Why do we eagerly consume pigs and cows, but balk at the idea of consuming veal or horse?’</p><a class="ctrl-s" href="meat-market.html"> Read or <span>Ctrl+S</span> this publication!</a></div></div><div class="mast-head home"><div><a href="living-light.html"><img src="assets/img/living-light/cover.png"></a><h1>Living Light</h1><h2>Ermi van Oers</h2><p>MISSING Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
